Day 7 looks like a search problem where the search space is defined by expansions of one bag into multiple bags based on color type.  For example:

`light red bags contain 1 bright white bag, 2 muted yellow bags.`

I think this will lend itself to the cons structure like so

```
'(" light red bag" . '( ( "bright white bag" . 1 ) ( "muted yellow bag" . 2 ) ) )
```
